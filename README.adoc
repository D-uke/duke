# Duke

## Getting Started

. Clone this repo
. `gradlew run -q --console=plain`

## Changes

* Messages are extracted into a utility class.
* Gradle build file is added.
* Unicode characters are changed to their escape sequence as they break on certain system locales.

## Known problems

. `gradle run` swallows the first input.
. Design flaw: utility classes are _usually_ bad.
In this case we could have inlined the message constants into their respective ``Command``s.
